{::comment}This post is designed to target people who ask questions that aren't clear and then take off. Folks are bugging them 
for clarification, and it's a huge waste of time. I'm also trying out a new tone, referring to ourselves rather than others. It 
kinda seems a little pretentious or condescending, so I'm not sure if it'll stick{:/}
## Being unresponsive is unhelpful {#introduction}
Commenters are asking for clarification so that they can answer our question, but we are leaving their questions unanswered.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
There are people trying to help us with our question, but after asking it, we haven't responded to requests for clarification. People are trying to answer our question, but they can't do it, because we were not clear enough when posting it. Since we are not responding, the people who are willing to help us are either not answering our question, or they are making educated guesses. If these guesses are incorrect, then they have wasted their time. 

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If our question is important enough to us to ask, it should be important enough for us to check back regularly to respond to anyone commenting on it. If we ignore our question, we are also ignoring people who are trying to help us. Their time spent analyzing our question, asking for clarification, and waiting for a response is wasted. If they hazard an answer that ends up being incorrect, the time spent on that is wasted. Wasting the time of people who are trying to help us is seen as very rude. 

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
If we are reading this because someone left it on our abandoned question, we should immediately return to our question and make all efforts to reply to anyone who has asked us for clarification. We should edit our question to include any additional information that has been requested, and then @reply in the comments to let people know that we have answered their question. And, in future, when we ask a question, we should keep that browser tab pinned open for at least a few hours after it is asked. We should check to see if comments or answers have been added every ten to fifteen minutes, and we should respond immediately to anyone's post. 

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
