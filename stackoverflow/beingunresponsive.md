{::comment}This post is designed to target people who ask questions that aren't clear and then take off. Folks are bugging them 
for clarification, and it's a huge waste of time. I'm also trying out a new tone, referring to ourselves rather than others. It 
kinda seems a little pretentious or condescending, so I'm not sure if it'll stick{:/}
## Being unresponsive is unhelpful {#introduction}
Commenters are asking for clarification so that they can answer my question, but I'm leaving their questions unanswered.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
There are people trying to help me with my question, but after asking it, I haven't responded to requests for clarification. People are trying to answer my question, but they can't do it, because I wasn't clear enough when posting it. Since I'm not responding, the people who are willing to help me are either not answering my question, or are making educated guesses. If these guesses are incorrect, they've wasted their time. 

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If my question is important enough to ask, it should be important enough for me to check back regularly to respond to anyone commenting on it. If I ignore my question, I'm also ignoring people who are trying to help me. Their time spent analyzing my question, asking for clarification, and waiting for a response is wasted. If they hazard an answer that ends up being incorrect, the time spent on that is wasted. Wasting the time of people who are trying to help me is seen as very rude. 

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
If I'm reading this because someone left it on my abandoned question, I should immediately return to my question and reply to anyone who has asked me for clarification. I should edit my question to include any additional information that has been requested, and then @reply in the comments to let people know that I've answered their questions. And, in the future, when I ask a question, I should keep that browser tab pinned open for at least a few hours after it is asked. I should check to see if comments or answers have been added every ten to fifteen minutes, and respond immediately to comments. 

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
