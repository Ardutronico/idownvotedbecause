## Badly indented, formatted, commented etc is very hard to read. {#introduction}
If the code is not properly indented, it is much harder to understand it. Bad commenting also makes it hard to understand it.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
You ask people to spend time for free to help you. Those who help you want to focus on the actual problem. They do not want to waste time trying to understand your code just because you could not take two minutes of your time to tidy it ip. 

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
Indentation is easy. All good IDE:s can do that automatically. And even if you are sitting with a text editor without this feature, it is still easy (although maybe tideus) to do. Putting in a comment here and there is also easy. Since all of is easy to do, it is very disrespectful not to do it. It shows that not much effort was put into writing the question. Remember, you are asking people to *help you,* ***free of charge***.  Doing everything you can to make it easy for others to understand your code is the least you can do. Failing to do so *wastes other people's time*, and wasting the time of other users who are trying to help is very rude.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
First, make sure your code is a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example (see [the Stack Overflow help center](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) for details on how to do this).

Make sure your code follows some indentation standard. Which one does not really matter as long as you are consistent. Allman is pretty popular. Read about indentation styles on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style)

Give your code some "air", but not to much. Sometimes some empty lines really helps reading, but do not overdo it and avoid empty lines that does not serve any purpose at all. This is not a huge deal, but a good rule of thumb is "is it pleasing to the eye?"

Give your variables and functions good names that describe what they do. A good rule of thumb here is that if you need to explain what a variable or a function does, it has a bad name. It is preferable to use English names.

Make sure your code is *well commented*. Note that "well" does not imply anything about the amount of comments. To much comments is equally bad as to little. Code without comments can be well commented. Remember that the comments should aim to make it easier for us to help you. It is a very good idea to put a comment where you think the problem is. 

When it looks good in your favourite editor, copy the code and paste it in your post. Mark all the code and press Ctrl-k to make a proper code block.
