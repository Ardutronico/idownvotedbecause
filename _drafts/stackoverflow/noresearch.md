## Research is an important first step in solving problems {#introduction}
{::comment}In this paragraph, give the user the tl;dr lowdown. {:/}
Solving problems is work. When one has exhausted their own knowledge, it's often tempting to simply ask someone else to solve the problem for you. However, Stack Overflow was created for the express purpose of providing a place where problems are solved. Many times, the problem you have is a problem someone else already had. And they've already asked on Stack Overflow, or elsewhere on the internet. Because of the vast amount of information on the internet and Stack Overflow, it is often just a search or two away.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
{::comment}In this section, detail why the post has problems{:/}
The question this page has been linked to does not demonstrate research has been done into possible solutions to the problem. **This does not mean that research has not been done!** Just that *evidence* of that research is lacking. Of course, it could also mean research was not done, or done hastily or poorly. 

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
The first part of the text which appears when hovering over the downvote button is "[t]his question does not show research effort". The first section on the [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) page is headed with "Search, and research". That's how important research is, not only to Stack Overflow, but to solving problems in general.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
Add evidence of your research. You don't have to link to every site or question you looked at, but you should at least reference the questions which look most like this one, and let people know why the answers did not help you. As the [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) page says:

> Even if you don't find a useful answer elsewhere on the site, including links to related questions that *haven't* helped can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest. 

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
