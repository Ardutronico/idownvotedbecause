{::comment}Trying a different tone in this one, referring to the OP as "we" instead of "you"{:/}
## It appears no attempt was made {#introduction}
We all have jobs to do. It may be homework, or work-work. No matter what, it's our responsibility to get the job done, and it is always worth the effort to at least try.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
We can't rely on other people to do our work for us. Asking others to do our work for us can also be seen as rude. If we try, we may succeed. But if we do not, we will always fail.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
It can be seen as very rude to ask other people do do our work for us. People will look and see if we made any effort at all, and if they see none, they may look upon us as lazy, and act negatively toward us, downvoting our question and voting to close.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
## Leave a comment! {#leaveacomment}
